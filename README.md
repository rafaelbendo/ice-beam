# Introduction

# ICESat-2 data Overview

ICESat-2 carries a single instrument, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a photon-counting lidar that emits green (532 nm) laser pulses at a rate of 10 kHz. This pulse rate produces an along-track sampling of approximately 0.7 m at the surface, which is well suited for resolving heterogeneous features such as the sea surface. (Markus et al., 2017). Only a small fraction of the emitted photons are scattered back toward the satellite, and the precise timing of each detected photon is used to determine surface elevation (Neumann et al., 2019). The laser beam is optically split into three pairs of beams, forming six ground tracks symmetrically distributed about the satellite’s reference ground track. Beams within each pair are separated by approximately 90 m across track, while the beam pairs are spaced about 3.3 km apart (Markus et al., 2017). ICESat-2 follows a near-polar orbit with a 91-day repeat cycle, allowing it to revisit the same ground tracks and measure elevation change over time (Neumann et al., 2019).
